                    h3 What We Collect
                    p Kick stores your Slack workspace name, workspace Id, and an authorization token on installation that grants permission to read public and private channel members.
                    p Kick does not save any team member's email address and therefore will not contact you via email.
                .row
                    h3 Installation Permissions
                    p Confirm your identity - Kick uses this permission to verify your account in Slack.
                    p Access information about your channels - Kick uses this permission to read the member Id's in the public channel where /pick was entered. The member Ids are used to randomly choose one member to complete the task. Member Id's are not saved.
                    p Add slash commands - Kick uses this permission to allow the /pick slash command.
                    p Access your workspace's profile information - Kick uses this permission to determine if channel members are online and are not a bot to determine eligibility to be picked.
                    p Send messages as @Kick - Kick uses this permission to completed scheduled picks. If a pick is scheduled for 8 AM every day, then Kick needs the permission to add a message to your channel to indicate who was picked for the task.
                .row
                    h3 Data Retention
